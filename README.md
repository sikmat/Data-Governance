# 1. DEFINING DATA GOVERNANCE
## Defining & Understanding Data Governance

### What is Data Governance?

Governance is the manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest. It typically takes the form of how decisions are made, regulated, and enforced. 
When entities grow and increase in complexity, formal governance becomes important. Left ungoverned, the possibility of devolving into chaos is very probable. 

_Governance is the system that formalizes control, processes, and accountabilities so that specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained._

Concerned with exploring techniques and approaches for deriving as much value from your data as possible while also managing any associated risks. 

- Discovery
- Classification
- Policy
- Rules
- Metadata

Well-managed data can be transformational, and it can support the desirable qualities of a data-driven culture. This is when decisions at all levels of the organization are made using data in an informed and structured manner such that they deliver better outcomes internally and to customers

Successful data governance also means that data risks can be minimized, and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease. This can bring important comfort to business leaders who, in some jurisdictions, can now be personally liable for issues arising from poor data management.

### Data Governance VS Data Management

_Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data. Data management is the technical implementation of data governance_. For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.

### Data Governance versus Information Governance 

_Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning_. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences. The interest here is in the data, not as much in the business context. _Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders._ 

You should understand the context of data, a concept known as data intelligence, and the desired business outcomes, to complement data governance efforts in a valuable manner.

### The Value of Data Governance

If an organization considers data to be a priority and it puts in place processes and policies to leverage the data’s value and reduce data risks, that organization is demonstrating a strong commitment to data controls and accountabilities. In other words, that organization values data governance.
Fundamentally, data governance is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it. It forces a leap from an ad hoc approach to data to one that is strategic in nature.

Some of the main advantages achieved by good data governance include:

1. Improved data quality
2. Expanded data value
3. Increased data compliance
4. Improved data-driven decision-making
5. Enhanced business performance
6. Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
7. Increased data availability and accessibility
8. Improved data search
9. Reduced risks from data-related issues
10. Reduced data management costs
11. Established rules for handling data

In the absence of formalized data governance, organizations will continue to struggle in achieving these advantages and may, in fact, suffer negative consequences. For example, poor-quality data that is not current, inaccurate, and incomplete can lead to operating inefficiencies and poor decision-making.
Data governance does not emerge by chance. It’s a choice and requires organizational commitment and investment.

## Creating a Data Governance Program

The basic steps for creating a data governance program:

1. Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
2. Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
3. Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
4. Achieving leadership approval.
5. Designing and developing the program.
6. Implementing the program.
7. Monitoring and measuring performance.
8. Maintaining the program.

_In summary, data governance is about managing data well and helping to deliver its optimum value to your organization. It includes ensuring your data is available, usable, and secure. It’s the actions that team members take, the policies and processes they must follow, and the use of technologies that support them throughout the data lifecycle in their organization._

## Developing a Data Governance Framework

Regardless of how and to what degree you implement the elements of a data governance program, you’ll need a basic set of guiding concepts and a structure in which to apply them. This is called the data governance framework.

Figure 2: Common components of a data governance framework.

The data governance framework in Figure 2 is not in a specific order, with the exception of leadership and strategy, which is a prerequisite for the rest of the framework.

### Leadership and Strategy
Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization. For example, how can data governance support the role that data plays in enabling growth in specific markets? Data plays a role in many aspects of organizational strategy, including risk management, innovation, and operational efficiencies, so you must ensure there’s a clear alignment between these aspects and the goals of data governance.

_The disconnect between business goals and data governance is the number one reason that data governance programs fail. When mapping organizational strategy to data governance, you need the support, agreement, and sponsorship of senior leadership. I’ll be blunt about this: Without full support from your organization’s leaders, your data governance efforts won’t succeed._

### Roles and Responsibilities
Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time. Every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities, which range from the information technology (IT) team to data stewards.

_While specific roles do exist, your organization must understand that data governance requires responsibilities from nearly everyone._

### Policies, Processes, and Standards
At the heart of every data governance program are the policies, processes, and standards that guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization. Each of these must be designed, developed, and deployed. Depending on the size and complexity of the organization, this can take significant effort.

_Policies, processes, and standards must include accountability and enforcement components; otherwise it’s possible they will be dead on arrival._

### Metrics
The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results. Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding. You’ll want to know if your efforts are delivering on the promise of the program. Based on the metrics, you and your team can make continuous improvements (or make radical changes) to ensure that the program is producing value.

### Tools
Fortunately, a large marketplace now exists for tools in support of data governance and management. These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance. In recent years, many data science-related tools have made leaps in terms of incorporating ease-of-use and automation. What used to be complex has been democratized and empowered more team members to better manage and derive value from data.

### Communications and Collaboration
With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key. This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops. Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.

_A large number of disparate stakeholders need to work together in order to effectively govern data. Collaboration is essential and can be the difference between success and failure. Good collaboration requires a positive culture that rewards teamwork. It also requires clear channels between teams, such as regular meetings. Online collaboration platforms are increasingly being used too._

## Preparing for Data Governance

Data governance requires careful treatment, beginning with understanding whether an organization is ready to accept it. Being ready as an organization involves determining the extent to which a data culture exists. Ensuring that the organization’s strategy is fully aligned with the proposed program. Misalignment here is the number one reason data governance program deployments fail.

### What is data culture?

Many well-designed projects and initiatives fall flat and fail even though their teams seem to have done everything right. Too often, the work gets deployed into an environment that is either not ready for change or doesn’t have the optimum conditions for success. 70 percent of organizations are failing because they don’t have the prerequisite data culture to support their tech upgrades.
Culture will always defeat the greatest of strategies almost every time. Imagine for a moment designing and deploying a data governance program for an organization that has little or no data culture.

_On a basic level, data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it. There’s a wide chasm between companies that simply manage data as a consequence of doing business versus those that consider data central to how their organization operates and makes decisions (the latter being the qualities exhibited by a mature data culture)._

### Assessing the Data Culture

Effective data cultures support and empower all employees, from the newest intern to the CEO, to access and use meaningful and timely data for their work. Such cultures ensure that employees have attained the skills they need to use data analytics and can make good data-driven decisions. 

_In a data culture, decisions don’t rely on gut feelings, guesses, or the opinion of the highest-paid/ranking person in the room. Rather, decisions are based on data and the insights they can produce._

To be competitive, a progressive data-driven strategy is no longer optional. It’s a central concern. Data culture can be now considered a new way of doing business in the digital age.

Leaders in all types of organizations are recognizing that to succeed in the third decade of the 21st century and beyond, they must leverage the enormous power and value of data. This acknowledgment, and the actions that senior leaders take to foster the use of data, is the primary success factor in the development and maturity of an effective data culture.

Trust comes in a close second. This means that team members will only make data-driven decisions if they trust the data they’re using. Trust is built when data is high-quality, its origin and value are understood, and team members know how it can contribute to the goals of the business.

To start, you need to assess the maturity of your organization’s data culture. You and your team can interview leaders and team members. You can also observe how people make decisions, how decisions are communicated, and the degree to which data is currently governed and managed. It won’t be just one thing that provides a score for your data culture, but a mix of inputs. If the conclusion is that your data culture is sufficient for the introduction of a data governance program, you’re in good shape.

_What you shouldn’t lose sight of here is that implementing data governance will be a positive and important contributing factor to building a data culture._

### Maturing the Data Culture

If you decide that you need to better prepare the organization for data governance by maturing the data culture, consider these items to start.

1. Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data.
2. Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization. Don’t overlook the remarkable capabilities of common applications such as spreadsheets.
3. Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress. A successful data culture doesn’t begin with the deployment of complex, far-reaching solutions. Rather, it can be eased into the organization via basic data-management skills offered in a classroom setting or online.
4. Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members. At a minimum, provide a channel for feedback and positive discussion.

### Assessing Data Governance Readiness

A few other items you should consider in order to determine if your organization is ready for a data governance program. If the right conditions don’t exist, you may be walking into a minefield, only one step away from disaster.
Unfortunately, the success rate of data governance programs on the first try remains low. It’s important to maximize the conditions for success. You may not get a second chance.

The following basic checklist of items will help you determine the data governance readiness of your organization:

1. The basis of a data culture exists.
2. The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.
3. Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.
4. Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department.
5. One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.
6. The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
7. The organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.
8. You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
9. Legal and compliance teams (internally or externally) understand and support the goals of the program.
10. Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
11. The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.

This list is not exhaustive and there may be other items you consider relevant to your organization.

_As you read through this course and begin planning your data governance program, return to this list often and assess the status of each item._

# 2. EXPLORING A WORLD OVERFLOWING WITH DATA

## Defining Data

Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, in other words, stuff that is kept on a computing device. These units represent something meaningful when processed for a human or a computer. Single units of data are traditionally referred to as datum and multiple units as data. However, the term data is often used in singular and plural contexts

Prior to processing, data doesn’t need to make sense individually or even in combination with other data. For example, data could be the word orange or the number 42. In the abstract and most basic form, something we call raw data, we can agree that these are both meaningless.

Data is also defined based on its captured format. Specifically, at a high level, it falls into one of the following categories:

**Structured**: Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.
**Unstructured**: Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.
Semi-structured: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.

_Units of data are largely worthless until they are processed and applied. It’s only then that data begins a journey that, when coupled with good governance, can be very useful. The value that data can bring to so many functions, from product development to sales, makes it an important asset._

To begin to have value, data requires effort, a theme I will keep returning to throughout this course. If we place the word orange in a sentence, such as “An orange is a delicious fruit,” suddenly the data has meaning. Similarly, if we say, “The t-shirt I purchased cost me R42.00,” then the number 42 now has meaning. What we did here was to process the data by means of structure and context to give it value. Put another way, we converted the data into information.

This basic action of data processing cannot be overstated, as it represents the core foundation of an industry that has ushered in our current period of rapid digital transformation. Today, the term data processing has been replaced with information technology (IT).

### Zettabyte

Today, we live in the zettabyte era. A zettabyte is a big number. A really big number. It’s 1021, or a 1 with 21 zeros after it. It looks like this: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.
This datasphere — the term used to describe all the data created — is projected to reach over 100 zettabytes by 2023 and may double in 3-4 years. If you own a terabyte drive at home or for school, you’d need one billion of those drives to store just one zettabyte of data.

Table 1a Quantification of Data Storage
Table 1b Examples of Data Volumes

8 bits=1 byte
1024 bytes=1 kilobyte
1024 kilobytes=1 megabyte
1024 megabytes=1 gigabyte
1024 gigabytes=1 terabyte
1024 terabytes=1 petabyte
1024 petabytes=1 exabyte
1024 exabytes=1 zettabyte
1024 zettabytes=1 yottabyte
1024 yottabytes=1 brontobyte

Table 1b: Examples of Data Volumes

**UNIT**                 **VALUE**             **EXAMPLE**
Kilobytes (KB) | 1,000 bytes | a paragraph of a text document
Megabytes (MB) | 1,000 Kilobytes | a small novel
Gigabytes (GB) | 1,000 Megabytes | Beethoven’s 5th Symphony
Terabytes (TB) | 1,000 Gigabytes | all the X-rays in a large hospital
Petabytes (PB) | 1,000 Terabytes | half the contents of all US academic research libraries
Exabytes (EB) | 1,000 Petabytes | about one fifth of the words people have ever spoken
Zettabytes (ZB) | 1,000 Exabytes | as much information as there are grains of sand on all the world’s beaches
Yottabytes (YB) | 1,000 Zettabytes | as much information as there are atoms in 7,000 human bod

Understanding that we are in an era of vastly expanding data volume, often at the disposal of organizations, elevates the notion that managing this data well is complex and valuable.

Managing a small amount of data can have challenges, but managing data at scale is materially more challenging. If you’re going to glean value from data, it has to be understood and managed in specific ways.
