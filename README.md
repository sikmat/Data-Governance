# 1. DEFINING DATA GOVERNANCE
## Defining & Understanding Data Governance

### What is Data Governance?

Governance is the manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest. It typically takes the form of how decisions are made, regulated, and enforced. 
When entities grow and increase in complexity, formal governance becomes important. Left ungoverned, the possibility of devolving into chaos is very probable. 

_Governance is the system that formalizes control, processes, and accountabilities so that specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained._

Concerned with exploring techniques and approaches for deriving as much value from your data as possible while also managing any associated risks. 

- Discovery
- Classification
- Policy
- Rules
- Metadata

Well-managed data can be transformational, and it can support the desirable qualities of a data-driven culture. This is when decisions at all levels of the organization are made using data in an informed and structured manner such that they deliver better outcomes internally and to customers

Successful data governance also means that data risks can be minimized, and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease. This can bring important comfort to business leaders who, in some jurisdictions, can now be personally liable for issues arising from poor data management.

### Data Governance VS Data Management

_Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data. Data management is the technical implementation of data governance_. For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.

### Data Governance versus Information Governance 

_Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning_. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences. The interest here is in the data, not as much in the business context. _Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders._ 

You should understand the context of data, a concept known as data intelligence, and the desired business outcomes, to complement data governance efforts in a valuable manner.

### The Value of Data Governance

If an organization considers data to be a priority and it puts in place processes and policies to leverage the data’s value and reduce data risks, that organization is demonstrating a strong commitment to data controls and accountabilities. In other words, that organization values data governance.
Fundamentally, data governance is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it. It forces a leap from an ad hoc approach to data to one that is strategic in nature.

Some of the main advantages achieved by good data governance include:

1. Improved data quality
2. Expanded data value
3. Increased data compliance
4. Improved data-driven decision-making
5. Enhanced business performance
6. Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
7. Increased data availability and accessibility
8. Improved data search
9. Reduced risks from data-related issues
10. Reduced data management costs
11. Established rules for handling data

In the absence of formalized data governance, organizations will continue to struggle in achieving these advantages and may, in fact, suffer negative consequences. For example, poor-quality data that is not current, inaccurate, and incomplete can lead to operating inefficiencies and poor decision-making.
Data governance does not emerge by chance. It’s a choice and requires organizational commitment and investment.

## Creating a Data Governance Program

The basic steps for creating a data governance program:

1. Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
2. Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
3. Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
4. Achieving leadership approval.
5. Designing and developing the program.
6. Implementing the program.
7. Monitoring and measuring performance.
8. Maintaining the program.

Figure 1: The most common elements of a data governance program

_In summary, data governance is about managing data well and helping to deliver its optimum value to your organization. It includes ensuring your data is available, usable, and secure. It’s the actions that team members take, the policies and processes they must follow, and the use of technologies that support them throughout the data lifecycle in their organization._

## Developing a Data Governance Framework

Regardless of how and to what degree you implement the elements of a data governance program, you’ll need a basic set of guiding concepts and a structure in which to apply them. This is called the data governance framework.

![image](https://github.com/sikmat/Data-Governance/assets/111583727/e5988bb1-24f3-4a0c-8663-e3ac0dec5c1c)

Figure 2: Common components of a data governance framework.

The data governance framework in Figure 2 is not in a specific order, with the exception of leadership and strategy, which is a prerequisite for the rest of the framework.

### Leadership and Strategy
Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization. For example, how can data governance support the role that data plays in enabling growth in specific markets? Data plays a role in many aspects of organizational strategy, including risk management, innovation, and operational efficiencies, so you must ensure there’s a clear alignment between these aspects and the goals of data governance.

_The disconnect between business goals and data governance is the number one reason that data governance programs fail. When mapping organizational strategy to data governance, you need the support, agreement, and sponsorship of senior leadership. I’ll be blunt about this: Without full support from your organization’s leaders, your data governance efforts won’t succeed._

### Roles and Responsibilities
Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time. Every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities, which range from the information technology (IT) team to data stewards.

_While specific roles do exist, your organization must understand that data governance requires responsibilities from nearly everyone._

### Policies, Processes, and Standards
At the heart of every data governance program are the policies, processes, and standards that guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization. Each of these must be designed, developed, and deployed. Depending on the size and complexity of the organization, this can take significant effort.

_Policies, processes, and standards must include accountability and enforcement components; otherwise it’s possible they will be dead on arrival._

### Metrics
The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results. Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding. You’ll want to know if your efforts are delivering on the promise of the program. Based on the metrics, you and your team can make continuous improvements (or make radical changes) to ensure that the program is producing value.

### Tools
Fortunately, a large marketplace now exists for tools in support of data governance and management. These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance. In recent years, many data science-related tools have made leaps in terms of incorporating ease-of-use and automation. What used to be complex has been democratized and empowered more team members to better manage and derive value from data.

### Communications and Collaboration
With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key. This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops. Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.

_A large number of disparate stakeholders need to work together in order to effectively govern data. Collaboration is essential and can be the difference between success and failure. Good collaboration requires a positive culture that rewards teamwork. It also requires clear channels between teams, such as regular meetings. Online collaboration platforms are increasingly being used too._

## Preparing for Data Governance

Data governance requires careful treatment, beginning with understanding whether an organization is ready to accept it. Being ready as an organization involves determining the extent to which a data culture exists. Ensuring that the organization’s strategy is fully aligned with the proposed program. Misalignment here is the number one reason data governance program deployments fail.

### What is data culture?

Many well-designed projects and initiatives fall flat and fail even though their teams seem to have done everything right. Too often, the work gets deployed into an environment that is either not ready for change or doesn’t have the optimum conditions for success. 70 percent of organizations are failing because they don’t have the prerequisite data culture to support their tech upgrades.
Culture will always defeat the greatest of strategies almost every time. Imagine for a moment designing and deploying a data governance program for an organization that has little or no data culture.

_On a basic level, data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it. There’s a wide chasm between companies that simply manage data as a consequence of doing business versus those that consider data central to how their organization operates and makes decisions (the latter being the qualities exhibited by a mature data culture)._

### Assessing the Data Culture

Effective data cultures support and empower all employees, from the newest intern to the CEO, to access and use meaningful and timely data for their work. Such cultures ensure that employees have attained the skills they need to use data analytics and can make good data-driven decisions. 

_In a data culture, decisions don’t rely on gut feelings, guesses, or the opinion of the highest-paid/ranking person in the room. Rather, decisions are based on data and the insights they can produce._

To be competitive, a progressive data-driven strategy is no longer optional. It’s a central concern. Data culture can be now considered a new way of doing business in the digital age.

Leaders in all types of organizations are recognizing that to succeed in the third decade of the 21st century and beyond, they must leverage the enormous power and value of data. This acknowledgment, and the actions that senior leaders take to foster the use of data, is the primary success factor in the development and maturity of an effective data culture.

Trust comes in a close second. This means that team members will only make data-driven decisions if they trust the data they’re using. Trust is built when data is high-quality, its origin and value are understood, and team members know how it can contribute to the goals of the business.

To start, you need to assess the maturity of your organization’s data culture. You and your team can interview leaders and team members. You can also observe how people make decisions, how decisions are communicated, and the degree to which data is currently governed and managed. It won’t be just one thing that provides a score for your data culture, but a mix of inputs. If the conclusion is that your data culture is sufficient for the introduction of a data governance program, you’re in good shape.

_What you shouldn’t lose sight of here is that implementing data governance will be a positive and important contributing factor to building a data culture._

### Maturing the Data Culture

If you decide that you need to better prepare the organization for data governance by maturing the data culture, consider these items to start.

1. Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data.
2. Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization. Don’t overlook the remarkable capabilities of common applications such as spreadsheets.
3. Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress. A successful data culture doesn’t begin with the deployment of complex, far-reaching solutions. Rather, it can be eased into the organization via basic data-management skills offered in a classroom setting or online.
4. Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members. At a minimum, provide a channel for feedback and positive discussion.

### Assessing Data Governance Readiness

A few other items you should consider in order to determine if your organization is ready for a data governance program. If the right conditions don’t exist, you may be walking into a minefield, only one step away from disaster.
Unfortunately, the success rate of data governance programs on the first try remains low. It’s important to maximize the conditions for success. You may not get a second chance.

The following basic checklist of items will help you determine the data governance readiness of your organization:

1. The basis of a data culture exists.
2. The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.
3. Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.
4. Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department.
5. One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.
6. The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
7. The organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.
8. You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
9. Legal and compliance teams (internally or externally) understand and support the goals of the program.
10. Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
11. The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.

This list is not exhaustive and there may be other items you consider relevant to your organization.

_As you read through this course and begin planning your data governance program, return to this list often and assess the status of each item._

# 2. EXPLORING A WORLD OVERFLOWING WITH DATA

## Defining Data

Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, in other words, stuff that is kept on a computing device. These units represent something meaningful when processed for a human or a computer. Single units of data are traditionally referred to as datum and multiple units as data. However, the term data is often used in singular and plural contexts

Prior to processing, data doesn’t need to make sense individually or even in combination with other data. For example, data could be the word orange or the number 42. In the abstract and most basic form, something we call raw data, we can agree that these are both meaningless.

Data is also defined based on its captured format. Specifically, at a high level, it falls into one of the following categories:

**Structured**: Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.
**Unstructured**: Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.
Semi-structured: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.

_Units of data are largely worthless until they are processed and applied. It’s only then that data begins a journey that, when coupled with good governance, can be very useful. The value that data can bring to so many functions, from product development to sales, makes it an important asset._

To begin to have value, data requires effort, a theme I will keep returning to throughout this course. If we place the word orange in a sentence, such as “An orange is a delicious fruit,” suddenly the data has meaning. Similarly, if we say, “The t-shirt I purchased cost me R42.00,” then the number 42 now has meaning. What we did here was to process the data by means of structure and context to give it value. Put another way, we converted the data into information.

This basic action of data processing cannot be overstated, as it represents the core foundation of an industry that has ushered in our current period of rapid digital transformation. Today, the term data processing has been replaced with information technology (IT).

## Zettabyte

![image](https://github.com/sikmat/Data-Governance/assets/111583727/31765279-9b18-43b8-9240-498dffaa6fda)
Figure 3: The qualitative and quantitative nature of data types

Today, we live in the zettabyte era. A zettabyte is a big number. A really big number. It’s 1021, or a 1 with 21 zeros after it. It looks like this: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.
This datasphere — the term used to describe all the data created — is projected to reach over 100 zettabytes by 2023 and may double in 3-4 years. If you own a terabyte drive at home or for school, you’d need one billion of those drives to store just one zettabyte of data.

Table 1a Quantification of Data Storage
Table 1b Examples of Data Volumes

8 bits=1 byte

1024 bytes=1 kilobyte

1024 kilobytes=1 megabyte

1024 megabytes=1 gigabyte

1024 gigabytes=1 terabyte

1024 terabytes=1 petabyte

1024 petabytes=1 exabyte

1024 exabytes=1 zettabyte

1024 zettabytes=1 yottabyte

1024 yottabytes=1 brontobyte


Table 1b: Examples of Data Volumes


**UNIT**                 **VALUE**             **EXAMPLE**

Kilobytes (KB) | 1,000 bytes | a paragraph of a text document

Megabytes (MB) | 1,000 Kilobytes | a small novel

Gigabytes (GB) | 1,000 Megabytes | Beethoven’s 5th Symphony

Terabytes (TB) | 1,000 Gigabytes | all the X-rays in a large hospital

Petabytes (PB) | 1,000 Terabytes | half the contents of all US academic research libraries

Exabytes (EB) | 1,000 Petabytes | about one fifth of the words people have ever spoken

Zettabytes (ZB) | 1,000 Exabytes | as much information as there are grains of sand on all the world’s beaches

Yottabytes (YB) | 1,000 Zettabytes | as much information as there are atoms in 7,000 human bod

Understanding that we are in an era of vastly expanding data volume, often at the disposal of organizations, elevates the notion that managing this data well is complex and valuable.

Managing a small amount of data can have challenges, but managing data at scale is materially more challenging. If you’re going to glean value from data, it has to be understood and managed in specific ways.

## From Data to Insight

Generally, an organization is onboarding data because it’s required for some purpose.
_Data that is never used is about as useful as producing reports that nobody reads. The assumption is that you have data for a reason. You have your data and it’s incredibly important to your organization, but it must be converted to information to have._

**Data**                                                         
- Raw
- Items such as chars, words, images, numbers, with no meaning in isolation
- No analysis dependency
- Unorganized and not dependet on context 
- Not typically useful alone
                            
 **Information**
 - Processed
 - Data that is organized and given context to have meaning
 - Dependent on the analysis of data
 - Organized and dependent on context
 - Useful alone

Information coupled with broader contextual concepts, practical application, and experience, it becomes _knowledge_. 
Knowledge is actionable(It's power)

When we apply reasoning, values and the broader universe of our knowledge and deep experiences to knowledge, we get _wisdom_.

Insight emerges from knowledge but is demonstrated through a combination of knowledge and wisdom. With insight, we’ve gained a deeper understanding of something and have the skills to think or see it differently.

Figure 4: The journey from data to insight.

Another depiction of the data-information-knowledge-wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy as a pyramid to manage knowledge is illustrated below:

Figure 5: Data leads to insight

_Every day, different organizations with access to the same data have different outcomes. While the best outcome can’t be guaranteed no matter which processes, tools, or skills are used, good practices such as the right level of data governance can absolutely lead to better results._

## The Role of Data in The 21st Century

Since the 19th century has helped us understand the world in completely new ways, improved our ability to make better-informed decisions, and supported our efforts to solve all manner of problems. Data has always been important. The role of data has grown, more data and improvement in the quality and availability

In these early decades of the 21st century, we are producing more data than we can handle, and the depth, breadth, and quality of the data that is being used are reshaping not just the tools and capabilities of our industries and cities, but the nature of how we learn, socialize, and entertain ourselves. It’s also elevating risks that we may previously have characterized as annoyances to a world today where a cyberattack can result in millions of dollars of losses in hours.

There’s an argument that data has become the most valuable asset in the world. If we believe that to be true, then we can say with confidence that we have entered a new era for data and one that our career will be defined by.

## Data-Driven Decision-Making

Perhaps one of the greatest values of data is its ability to help us all make better decisions. Intuitively reading the customer reviews of a restaurant on a website such as Hello Peter or Google Reviews can help you decide whether you want to eat there. It’s valuable to you, but it’s also valuable to the restaurant owner. Those reviews can make a big difference, including being a motivation for action. Perhaps the restrooms should be cleaner.

Deciding to enter a new market with an existing product or service requires a deep understanding that can come from rich sets of data. If the data exists and you have the tools to process and interpret it, you may be well-positioned to make the right decision. It may also be easier to decide because you’re able to get the answers to your concerns. Conversely, without good data and the skills and tools to analyze it, a bad and costly decision may result. This happens far too often.
 
_The availability of abundant good quality data has been a boon for decision-making. You should note that I said good-quality data. Consider this; if you make a decision based on bad data, your challenges will be entirely different. **Abundant data is a product of the 21st century, but quality data is the product of deliberate actions**. Data governance plays a central role when aspiring for data quality._

## Data as The New Oil

Like oil, data has value but must first be processed to be useful. Specifically, oil is refined to make gas, plastics, and other useful chemicals. In a similar fashion, data must be organized and analyzed to understand patterns, make decisions, identify problems, and feed other systems.

_Without these additional steps of organizing and analyzing, oil and data are similar in that they are notably messy and unusable in their raw form._

The big economic powerhouses are being powered by data, such as the technology firms Facebook and Google. While they dominate, every other industry from banking to government and beyond is being reinvented by digitalization and data. Many are moving data management from a cost center to a profit center by making data power their businesses and generate new sources of revenue.

Like oil, those who control large repositories of high-value data have disproportionate power. The challenges and results of our dependency on oil through the 20th century are well known. There are lessons here that should inform us and warn us about the risks of personal data being managed by just a few big market players.

## Data Ownership

Data ownership describes the rights a person, team, or organization has over one or more data sets. These rights may span from lightweight oversight and control to rigorous rules that are legally enforceable. For example, data associated with intellectual property — items such as copyrights and trade secrets — will likely have high degrees of protection, from accessibility rights to who can use the data and for what purpose.

## Data Architecture

Nowadays almost every organization is a technology business. All businesses need systems to support their operations and deliver their products and services.

**Enterprise Architecture (EA**) is the practice of designing the technical needs of an organization to support its business strategy. 
Using standards and established principles, organizations can analyze, design, plan, and implement the right technologies, policies, and projects to support business goals.

A subset of EA, **Data Architecture** is the manner in which data design and management decisions are being made to align with EA and in turn, with the business. 
**Data Architecture is the agreed blueprint for how data supports an organization’s functions and technologies.**

_When high-quality enterprises and data architectures both exist, organizations run more smoothly, and they can transform as conditions (either internally or in the marketplace) dictate. The absence or poor implementation of both can stifle digital transformation efforts, create high levels of complexity, and increase the possibility of failure._

At a minimum, data architecture considers and typically supports the following:

- Ensuring data is available to those who need it and are approved to use it.
- Reducing the complexity of accessing and utilizing data
- Creating and enforcing data protections to support organizational policies and obligations.
- Adopting and agreeing to data standards
- Optimizing the flow and efficient use of data to eliminate bottlenecks and duplication

Data architecture is a direct reflection of data governance. An established and functioning data architecture immediately signals that an organization values data, manages it as a critical business asset, and has controls in place to ensure that it aligns with business needs. Indeed, like EA, data architecture is not the exclusive realm of technologists but a cross-organizational responsibility. In most medium to large organizations, data must efficiently flow across business silos, such as sales and product development, and serve many different audiences in multiple forms.

## The Lifecycle of Data

All data goes through phases during its lifecycle

![image](https://github.com/sikmat/Data-Governance/assets/111583727/e6709649-98e1-4c78-84ad-f153ea5fd142)
Figure 6: The lifecycle of data

1. **Creation**:  This is the stage at which data comes into being. It may be manual or automated and get created internally or externally. Data is created all the time by a vast number of activities that include system inputs and outputs.
2. **Storage**:  Once data is created and assuming you want it available for later use, it must be stored. It most likely will be contained and managed in a database. The database needs a home, too as a local hard drive, server, or cloud service.
3. **Usage**:  Hopefully you’re capturing and storing data because you want to use it. Maybe not immediately, but at some point, perhaps for analysis. Data may need to be processed to be useful. That could include cleansing it of errors, transforming it to another format, and securing access rights.
4. **Archival**:  In this stage, you identify data that is not currently being used and move it to a long-term storage system out of your production environment. If it's needed at some point in the future, it can be retrieved and utilized.
5. **Destruction**:  Despite a desire by some to keep everything forever, there is a logical point where destruction makes sense or is required by regulation or policy. Data destruction involves making data inaccessible and unreadable. It can include the physical destruction of a device such as a hard drive.

_The idea that data is in different states at different times is an essential context of data governance. Depending on the stage of its life, data may be treated differently and have unique requirements. For example, the security needs of data being regularly used will differ from data in an archival state._

## Understanding the Impact of Data

One by-product of the Cold War, the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union, accelerated innovation in computing and telecommunications.

### The Role of The U.S. Census in The Information Revolution

Processing data on some form of computing device has been around since the late 1800s. In fact, the need for a mechanism to better tabulate the results of the U.S. constitutional requirement to conduct a population census every ten years is said to be the origin of data processing. Counting all the people and other data points in the 1880 census took almost eight years. It’s assumed it was full of errors. It was also a boring, tedious process. Credit for the first company to automate and commercialize the processing of this data goes to the Tabulating Machine Company, founded in 1896.

The Tabulating Machine Company was later renamed International Business Machines, **IBM**. The rest, as they say, is history.

These major developments and others culminated in what we now know as the _3rd industrial revolution: the information age_. Data quickly became the raw material feeding a new generation of productivity and ideas. Connectivity provided the arteries for information to freely flow across devices, organizations, and geographies with few limitations.

The result? Data creation, storage, and use exploded. By the turn of this century, we were creating data at unprecedented levels. Data volume and velocity had become so unwieldy that it was creating a data swamp — a term for out-of-control amounts of data — that made it difficult for traditional software applications to manage. Observing this notable phenomenon, someone smart came up with a term to describe the scale and challenge of all the data. They called it _**Big Data**_.

## Defining Big Data

_Big data is structured and unstructured data that is so massive and complex in scale, that it’s difficult and often impossible to process via traditional data management techniques._

### Defining Big Data
One way to define and characterize big data is through these five Vs:

- **Volume**: The sheer scale of data being produced is unprecedented and requires new tools, skills, and processes.
- **Variety**: There are already a lot of legacy file formats, such as CSV and MP3, and with new innovations, new formats are emerging all the time. This requires different methods of handling, from analysis to security.
- **Velocity**: With so many collection points, digital interfaces, and ubiquitous connectivity, data is being created and moved at increasing speed. Consider that in 2021, Instagram users created, uploaded, and share 65,000 pictures a minute.
- **Variability**:  The fact that the creation and flow of data are unpredictable.
- **Veracity**:  The quality, including accuracy and truthfulness, of large volume of disparate sets of data, can differ considerably, causing challenges to data management.

### Drivers of Big Data
At a technology conference in 2003, the then-CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt. At the time said that every two days the world was creating more data than all the data created since the dawn of civilization.

_Big data was a thing even before Android and Apple smartphones and apps started generating data. This was before we had connected billions of devices, called the Internet of Things (IoTs), which would eventually begin collecting all manner of data. Big data even predates videos of cats published every day on social media platforms._

By the third decade of the 21st century, with so many devices connected and the world in a state of digital transformation, the volume of data being created had experienced a Cambrian explosion — a term the data science community has adopted from an early period in history notable for the rapid introduction of life into the natural environment. We were regularly well into the zettabyte range of data and its growth curve was continuing relentlessly (see Figure 7).

![image](https://github.com/sikmat/Data-Governance/assets/111583727/e2ce5656-2fc4-4b02-b5f0-a41c2d8ba0d1)

Figure 7: Data growth in zettabytes from 2010 to 2025

In 2021, global technology use generated 79 zettabytes of data, and it is anticipated to hit 180 zettabytes in 2025. A learner seeing this course in 2040 might read the previous sentence and not be impressed at such small numbers, the same way a 32GB smartphone was considered a large amount of space in 2015.

### Consequences of Big Data

**_While these big data statistics are impressive, they don’t really paint the full picture. It might be easy, for example, to assume that all the data is good quality. You might believe it is easy to analyze. You may even think it is easily accessible. Most of these assumptions and many related ones will likely be incorrect. For starters, up to 80 percent of data is unstructured. That’s a challenge right there. The vast majority of organizations struggle with unstructured data. In addition, a lot of this data is duplicative. Some of it will be bad data, which means it can’t be trusted, has errors, or includes some other substantive challenge._**

A combination of hyperconnectivity and data helps marketers using the latest technology to better understand the marketplace in granular detail. They can target specific audiences, and even specific individuals, where the chance of a sale is highest.

Big data is making this happen.

### What about small data?

_While so many of our business activities in the digital economy are driven by big data, there are still a lot of small data sets that are instrumental in decision-making and day-to-day operations. Think about all the spreadsheets that come by your inbox, the short surveys, or those go-to lists that we’ve all compiled and can’t live without. It’s not nearly as glamorous as big data, but in some cases, it may be argued as valuable._

Big questions can be answered in small data.

In fact, big data is often more meaningful when broken into smaller, more manageable chunks - an increasingly popular definition of small data. Smaller, logically arranged data can be the way to make sense of big data. In some circumstances, it may be the only way.

### Enter the Realm of Smart Data

Smart data has emerged as a new term that defines big data that’s been optimally prepared for use to deliver the highest business value. Instead of being overwhelmed by the distractions inherent to the volume, velocity, and variety of data in big data sets, processes are applied to big data to prepare it for specific uses. For example, marketing teams can target potential customers with precision. Analytics applications can use high-quality real-time data generated in a manufacturing setting.

Smart data uses new processes and tools to make the data most useful. For example, the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) is now being applied to find patterns in unstructured big data and extract the data that is most relevant for a given application. Using new methods such as AI reduces time, lowers errors, and enables the creation of data subsets that may not have been previously possible. In addition, smart data solutions are often applied at the point of collection rather than a post-processing solution.

In the 21st century we must recognize that all data can have value — big, small, and smart. Data governance is concerned with data no matter what form it takes.

# 3. DRIVING VALUE THROUGH DATA

## Identifying The Roles of Data

Recognizing the incredible diversity of data use and the exposure it has across all business functions reinforces its importance. It's critical to ensure that data is high quality, secure, compliant, and accessible to the right people at the right time.

Data isn’t something that just concerns the data analytics team or the information technology department. It’s also not something that is limited to decision-makers and leaders.

### Operations

Business operations concern themselves with a diverse set of activities to run the day-to-day needs and drive the mission of an organization.
_Operations run on and are powered by a variety of data and information sources. They also create a lot of both, too._

The performance of operations is often easily quantified by data. For example, in a human resources (HR) function, they’ll want to know how many openings there are, how long openings are taking to fill, and who is accepting offers. There’s a multitude of data points to quantify the answers to these so that relevant decisions can be made.

In HR, data is also created by the activities of the function. For example, candidates enter data when they apply for a position, data is entered when evaluating an applicant, and all along the way the supporting systems log a variety of automated data, such as time, date, and how long an application took to complete online.

In this HR example, and presumably, in any other operations teams explored, data is created in abundance as a result of and in support of functions.

Operations use data to make decisions, enable systems to run, and deliver data to internal and external entities. For example, a regional sales team will deliver their monthly results to headquarters to be presented to vice presidents or the C-suite.

Many data functions in support operations are automated. For example, a warehouse inventory system may automatically generate a replenishment order when stock drops to a certain level

### Strategy

Every organization has a strategy. At the organizational level, this is about creating a plan that supports objectives and goals. It’s essentially about understanding the challenges to delivering on the organization’s purpose and then agreeing on the proposed solutions to those challenges. Strategy can also be adopted at the department and division levels, but the intent is the same: understand the journey ahead and make a plan.

Strategy leads to implementation and requires the support of operations to realize its goals. In this way, strategy and operations are two sides of the same coin. Done right, a data-driven strategy delivered with operational excellence can be a winning ticket. 

Creating a strategy typically comes down to a core set of activities. It begins with an analysis of the environment followed by some conclusions on what has been gathered. Finally, a plan is developed, driven by some form of guiding principles. These principles may be derived from the nature of the work, the values of the founders, or some other factors.

_Deeply tied to all these steps is the availability of good quality data that can be processed and analyzed and then turned into actionable insights._

Certainly, data and information won’t be the only mechanisms in which the plan will be constructed. There must be room for other perspectives, including the strength of belief that people with experience bring to the discussion. The right mix of data and non-data sources must be considered. Too much of one or the other may not deliver the expected results.

**Note**: _A best practice for strategy development is to consider it an ongoing process. This doesn’t mean updating the strategy every month — as strategies are intended to last for several years — but it may mean revisiting the strategy every six months and tweaking it as necessary. Revisions to strategy should be guided by new data, which can mean new knowledge and new insights. While a regular process of strategy revisions is encouraged, new information that suddenly presents itself can trigger an impromptu update._

In the 21st century, organizations need to react quickly to environmental conditions to survive. Data will form the backbone of your response system.

### Decision-Making

It’s generally accepted in business that the highest form of value derived from data is the ability to make better-informed decisions. Popular consumer search engines such as Google and Bing have transformed how we make decisions

Within organizations, access to abundant data and information has resulted in quicker, timeous, and better-quality business decisions. For example, executives can understand their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats closer to real time.

_While there’s little surprise that data-driven decision-making is a fundamental business competency, it all hinges on decision-makers getting access to quality data at the right time. Abundant and out-of-date data are not synonymous with data value. Bad data may be worse than no data. Bad data processed into information and then used as the basis for decisions will result in failure. The outcome of decisions based on bad data could range from a minor mistake to job termination right up to the closing of the business._

### Measuring

Organizations are in a continuous state of measurement, whether it’s overt or tacit. Every observed unit of data contributes to building a picture of the business. The often-used adage, what gets measured gets managed, is generally applicable. That said, some things are hard to measure and not everything gets measured.

The aspiration for every leader is that they have the information they need when they need it. You might not always think of it this way, but that information is going to be derived from data that is a result of some form of measurement.

_Data measurements can be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data is most often described in numerical terms, whereas qualitative data is descriptive and expressed in terms of language._

_The type of information desired directly correlates to the measurement approach. This is going to inform your choices of at least what, when, where, and how data is captured. A general rule is only to capture and measure what matters. Some may argue that capturing data now to measure later has value even if there isn’t a good case yet. I can buy that but be careful with your limited resources and the potential costs._

William Bruce Cameron, “Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.”

### Monitoring

This is an ongoing process of collecting and evaluating the performance of, say, a project, process, system, or another item of interest. Often the results collected are compared against some existing values or desired targets. Across a wide range of activities, monitoring also helps to ensure the continuity, stability, and reliability of that being supervised.

_Involved in monitoring is the data produced by the thing being evaluated. It’s also the data that is produced as a product of monitoring. For example, the deviation from the expected result._

The data produced through monitoring feeds reports, real-time systems, and software-based dashboards.

Monitoring is another process that converts data into insight and as such, exists as a mechanism to guide decisions. The role of data in measurement and monitoring often go hand-in-hand. Intuitively you know you have to measure something that you want to monitor. The takeaway here is not the obvious relationship they have, but the fact that data is a type of connective tissue that binds business functions. This interdependence requires oversight and controls, as stakeholders often have different responsibilities and permissions.

Data monitoring is also the process of evaluating the quality of data and determining if it is fit for purpose. To achieve this, it requires processes, technologies, and benchmarks. Data monitoring begins with establishing data quality metrics and then measuring results over time on a continuous basis. Data quality monitoring metrics may include areas such as completeness and accuracy. 

_By continuously monitoring the quality of the data in your organization, opportunities and issues may be revealed in a timely manner. Then, if deemed appropriate, actions can be prioritized._

### Insight Management

Business insight is sometimes referred to as information that can make a difference.

_It’s not enough to simply collect lots of data and expect that insight will suddenly emerge. There must be an attendant management process. Thus, insight management means ensuring that data and information are capable of delivering insight._

Insight management _begins with gathering and analyzing data from different sources_. In order to determine what data to process, those responsible for insight management must deeply understand the organization’s information needs. They must be knowledgeable about what data has value. In addition, these analysts must know how information flows across the organization and who it must reach.

With the data gathered and processed, _analytics will be applied_ — this is the interpretation of the data and its implications.

Finally, insight management involves_ designing and creating the most effective manner to communicate any findings_. For different audiences, different mechanisms may be required. This is seldom a one-size-fits-all. Some people will want an executive summary while others may want the painful details. You’ll know whether your organization’s insight communications are working if those who receive it can make decisions that align with the goals of the organization.

_For an insight to be most valuable, it must be the right information, at the right time, in the right format, for the right people. But this in general is no simple task._

As you’ve probably guessed, there’s a strong overlap between insight management and knowledge management. For simplicity, you can think of knowledge management as the organizational support structures and tools to enable insight to be available to employees for whatever reason they need it.

### Reporting

Creating, delivering, receiving, and acting on reports are fundamental functions of any organization. The content of a report, which can be summarized or detailed, contains data and information in a structured manner. A chart considered a visual form of storytelling, is a way to present data so that it can be interpreted more quickly. With so much data and complexity in today’s business environment, data storytelling is growing as both a business requirement and as an in-demand business skill. The report may have a discussion of the findings and will conclude with a summary and sometimes a set of recommendations.

_Reports are typically online or physical presentations of data and information on some aspect of an organization. For example, a written and printed report may show all the sales of a particular product or service during a specific period. Sometimes a report is given verbally in person or via a live or recorded video. Whatever the format — and that’s less important today as long as it achieves its objective — a report is developed for a particular audience with a specific purpose._

_While reports do empower leaders and give them more tools, they don’t guarantee the right decisions. Knowing something is not the equivalent of making the right choices at the right time._

### Other Roles for Data

- **Artificial intelligence (AI)**:  Data is considered the fuel of AI. It requires a high volume of good data. With huge quantities of quality data, the outcomes of AI improve. It’s from the data that AI learns patterns, identifies relationships, and determines probabilities. In addition, AI is being used to improve the quality and use of data in organizations. 
- **Problem-solving**:  Acknowledging the close association with decision-making, it’s worth calling out problem-solving as a distinctive use of data. Data plays a role in how a problem is defined, determining what solutions are available, evaluating which solution to use, and measuring the success or failure of the solution that is chosen and applied.
- **Data reuse**:  While we collect and use data for a specific primary purpose, data is often reused for entirely different reasons. Data that has been collected, used, and stored can be retrieved and used by a different team at another time - assuming they have permission, including access and legal rights (notable controls within data governance). For example, the sales team in an organization will collect your name and address in order to fulfill an order. Later, that same data set may be used by the marketing team to create awareness about other products and services. These are two different teams with different goals using the same data. Data reuse can be considered a positive given that it reduces data collection duplication and increases the value of data to an organization, but it must be managed with care so that it doesn’t break any data use rules. (Note: **High-value shared data sets are called master data, and in data governance, they are subject to master data management**.)

## Improving Outcomes With Data

It’s useful to understand how data can be leveraged to acquire its maximum value. It begins with recognizing that data is an organizational asset. This simply means that it’s something that brings economic value to the organization. When data is considered an asset - in fact, specifically a high-value asset - it often gets treated differently.

_Perhaps the function that is most associated with data is the process of exploring it and looking for insights. Called data analytics, this is a comprehensive organizational function that requires skilled staff and tools. With the emergence of big data, data analytics has become more complex and requires deeper skills, but it’s also made data more valuable and important to the business._

## Approaching Data as an Asset

An asset is something that is owned by a person, an organization, or a government with the expectation that it can bring some economic benefit. This includes the generation of income, the reduction of expenses, or an increase in net worth.

_An asset can be tangible or intangible. Tangible assets are physical things such as inventory, machines, and property. That’s stuff you can see and touch. An intangible asset is the opposite; it’s a non-physical thing like software, copyrights, a brand, and goodwill. Data is an intangible asset._

After it is processed from its raw form, data has the potential to create enormous economic value for all manner of stakeholders. Here are some examples of the economic value of data:

- Improves operations.
- Increases existing revenue.
- Produces new forms of revenue.
- Builds relationships with customers and other stakeholders.
- Improves the quality of products and services.
- Contributes to competitive advantage.
- Enables innovation.
- Reduces risk.

Recognizing that data is an asset is the first step to good data governance.

When you think of data as an asset, you’ll be concerned with whether it is good or bad data. You’ll pay attention to the data’s accuracy, completeness, validity, and more. It means the organization will be mindful of whether data is being used as an organizational resource or being hidden in silos. This will mean understanding how the data is being managed and who has responsibility for it. Without roles and accountabilities, data can’t truly be managed well.

**Bottom line**: Data is an asset and for its value to be leveraged, it must be governed. This may be one of the most important motivations for good data governance.

## Data Analytics

The process of examining data in order to produce answers or find conclusions is called data analytics. A formal and disciplined approach is conducted by a data analyst, and it’s a necessary step for any individual or organization that’s trying to make good decisions for their organization.

The process of data analytics is varied depending on resources and context but generally follows the steps outlined in Figure 8:

![image](https://github.com/sikmat/Data-Governance/assets/111583727/21bb8577-42b3-427e-a05c-92b7579b3ed4)
Figure 8: Basics steps in data analysis

Data analytics has four primary types.

- **Descriptive**:  Existing data sets of historical data are accessed, and analysis is performed to determine what the data tells stakeholders about the performance of a key performance indicator (KPI) or other business objectives. It is insight on past performance.
- **Diagnostic**:  As the term suggests, this analysis tries to glean from the data the answer to why something happened. It takes descriptive analysis and looks at the cause.
- **Predictive**:  In this approach, the analyst uses techniques to determine what may occur in the future. It applies tools and techniques to historical data and trends to predict the likelihood of certain outcomes.
- **Prescriptive**:  This analysis focuses on what action should be taken. In combination with predictive analytics, prescriptive techniques provide estimates of the probabilities of a variety of future outcomes.

Figure 9: The relative complexity and business value of four types of analytics

_Data analytics involves the use of a variety of software tools depending on the needs, complexities, and skills of the analyst. Beyond your favorite spreadsheet program, which can deliver a lot of capabilities, data analysts use products such as R, Python, Tableau, Power BI, QlikView, and others._

## Data Management

Data governance concerns itself with, for example, defining the roles, policies, controls, and processes for increasing the quality and value of organizational data.

Data management is the implementation of data governance. Without data management, data governance is just wishful thinking. To get value from data, there must be execution.

If you collect and store data, technically you’re managing that data. What matters in data management is the degree of sophistication that is applied to managing the value and quality of data sets. If it’s on the low side, data may be a bottleneck rather than an advantage. Poor data management often results in data silos across an organization, security and compliance issues, errors in data sets, and overall low confidence in the quality of data.

### Who would choose to make decisions based on bad data?

When data is handled and treated as a valuable enterprise asset: insights are richer and timelier, operations run smoother, and team members have what they need to make more informed decisions. Well-executed data management can translate to reduced data security breaches, and lower compliance, regulatory, and privacy issues.

Data management processes involve the collection, storage, organization, maintenance, and analytics of an organization’s data. It includes the architecture of technology systems such that data can flow across the enterprise and be accessed whenever and by whom it is approved for use. Additionally, responsibilities will likely include such areas as data standardization, encryption, and archiving.

### Governing Data

Governing data means that some level of control exists to support a related policy. _For example, an organization may decide that to reduce risk, there needs to be a policy that requires data to be backed up every day. The control would be the documentation of the process and enforcement of that policy. If, in the review of policy adherence, data wasn’t getting backed up, then you’d quickly know that governance, for whatever reason, was not working._

The success of governing data can be reduced to three essential factors:

- **People**:  While recognizing that data is increasingly created and used exclusively by machines without human intervention, handling and benefiting from data is still a highly people-centric exercise. Even in a machine-centric context, it’s people who are most often defining, designing, and maintaining data use. In governing data, people are the subject matter experts, they are responsible for quality, and they oversee and manage all related processes and responsibilities.
- **Policies**:  A data policy contains a set of adopted rules by an organization that apply to the handling of data in specific conditions and for particular desired outcomes. These policies apply in areas such as quality, privacy, retention, and security. The number of policies is typically a reflection of the size of the organization, the industry, and the degree to which data is considered a high-priority asset. As you can imagine, the healthcare and financial industries, for example, which manage high volumes of sensitive data, have a significant number of data policies in support of their data governance programs.
- **Metrics**:  It’s largely true, what gets measured gets managed. In developing policies in support of data governance, you have to consider how each is measured. For example, if a policy states that there shouldn’t be more than five risk events per month such as a regulatory requirement being out of compliance, then, assuming the metric is high to begin with, it should decrease over time. If it doesn’t decrease or it does and then fluctuates widely, there’s an issue with the relevant data management procedures. Metrics must be in support of both technical and business needs. 

# 4. TRANSFORMING THROUGH DATA

## Examining the Broader Value of Data

The ability of team members to access data that they need for their work, without having to rely on specialists, is called data democratization.

_As organizations grow and more systems are employed, eventually no single person knows what data is available and where it is in the enterprise. Without this knowledge, the ability to properly govern your data and leverage its value is greatly hampered. Without deliberate actions, data democratization becomes elusive._

A data silo is a data repository controlled by an entity in an organization but not frequently shared or known by other parts of the business. Data silos hinder business efficiencies because they reduce collaboration and increase data inconsistencies. In addition, they are a source of risk, including security and regulatory issues.

Data governance helps eliminate unnecessary data siloes and makes data discoverable and available whenever and wherever it adds value. 

Unfortunately, most organizations don’t automatically come with a universal search engine that can help locate and serve up any type of data or information stored in the enterprise. Being able to tame and explore data sprawl — a term for the myriad of data types and sources that most businesses grapple with today — is not easily achieved without investing specialized effort.

Knowing what data is available is essential for the following reasons:

- Better informed decision-making.
- Ensuring compliance and regulatory requirements.
- Lower costs by avoiding duplicate system and data efforts.
- Improved data analytics and reporting.
- Higher performing systems.
- More efficient operations.
- Reducing data inconsistencies across the enterprise.
Fortunately, the vendor community is ready to help you build your internal search capabilities. It’s taken some time, but solutions have come a long way. With investment and effort, finding data and information in the enterprise is possible.

## Data Catalogs

Like a store catalog that categorizes products and includes details such as availability and price, a data catalog lists the availability of data sets and includes a wide range of valuable details about that data.

The three essential benefits of data catalogs are:

- **Finding data**: Helps users identify and locate data that may be useful.
- **Understanding data**:  Answers a wide variety of data questions such as its purpose and who uses it.
- **Making data more useful**:  Creates visibility, describes value, and provides access to information.

_Done right, a data catalog delivers a comprehensive inventory that provides an enterprise view of all data. This view provides essential insight that helps with leveraging data value and provides a robust tool to assist with data governance._

![image](https://github.com/sikmat/Data-Governance/assets/111583727/d2e6835c-d1f4-44aa-a97f-4cdfbecbfc55)

Figure 10: A basic orientation of the components of a data catalog

What makes a data catalog particularly valuable is that it contains data about the data. It’s called metadata. This content can be curated manually and also by automated processes which can acquire it from other sources. Artificial intelligence (AI) is now playing a growing role in the latter.

A data catalog can contain three types of metadata: technical, business, and operational.

- **Technical metadata**:  Data about the design of a data set such as its tables, columns, file names, and other documentation related to the source system.
- **Business metadata**:  Organizational data such as a business description, how it is used, its relevancy, an assessment of data quality, and users and their interactions.
- **Operational metadata**:  Data such as when the data was last accessed, who accessed it, and when was it last backed up.

Examples of metadata include the following:

- Associated systems.
- File names.
- File locations.
- Data owners.
- Data descriptions.
- Dates created.
- Dates last modified.
- List of database tables and views.
- Data stewards.
- Size of data sets.
- Quality score.
- Comments.

For a large number of stakeholders ranging from data analysts to data stewards, a data catalog presents many advantages. Primarily, the ability to find data tops the list. But it provides much more than that.

With a data catalog, an organization can:

- Know what data it has (and by extension, know what data is missing).
- Reduce data duplication.
- Increase operational efficiencies and innovation.
- Understand data quality.
- Manage compliance.
- Enjoy cost savings from improved operations.

_A well-managed data catalog can be transformational for an organization. The effort to create and maintain one should not be understated. But, without a doubt, a data catalog is often the basis for delivering successful data governance and data management._

## Case Study: Unlocking Data Silos With a Data Catalog

### From Data to Insights

Insight provides a deep understanding of something and is the ultimate positive manifestation of data. It has the highest value to an organization because it can support decisions and drive actions.

Whether an organization uses insight to support decisions or drive actions is a choice. Most organizations will do some of both, but when insights are used primarily to drive action, the value of the underlying data is truly realized. Put another way, actionable data is the most valuable data to an organization.

_If you can’t use your data to make better decisions and drive your organization forward, the data may just be worthless._

Acquiring and applying insight from data means defining the following:

- **Context**: Understanding the environment and objectives of the outcome
- **Need**: Determining how insight will help to accomplish the objective
- **Vision**: Having ideas about how insight will help and what that might look like in practice
- **Outcome**: Specifying how insights will be adopted and success will be measured

These dimensions can be used to answer questions such as:

- What data is required?
- Does the data exist?
- Is it current?
- Is it easily available?
- What format is the data in?
- What kind of data analysis is required?
- How will the data be presented?

_Converting data into insights is no easy task. It’s complicated and skilled work and relies on good quality data that is accessible. Those tasked with delivering insights often cite data quality, data volume, work effort, and integrating data from various sources as the top reasons that make it difficult and create a deterrent to adoption._

## Data Analytics

Data analysis is concerned with identifying a data set, examining it, and reporting on any findings. It’s a subset of data analytics and it typically focuses on what data from the past tells us. On the other hand, data analytics is a complete science that involves collecting, cleaning, organizing, storing, administering, and analyzing data. In addition to informing you about the past, it is also used to help project possibilities into the future.

The similarity in terms and overall purpose should be noted, but understanding the difference is important.

The source of data for analytics is one or a combination of the following:

**First-party data**:  Data that an organization collects.
**Second-party data**:  Data that is obtained from another organization.
**Third-party data**:  Aggregated data obtained from a provider.

Typical uses of contemporary data analytics tools and techniques include:

- Vastly improved decision-making
- Focused marketing campaigns
- Understanding the competitive landscape
- Designing more innovative products
- Better customer service
- Improved operations
- Insights on customer behavior

_Any organization that is serious about increasing the use of data for a wide range of business purposes must be ready to govern its data analytics capabilities. This includes policies and procedures, experienced talent, and a suite of contemporary software tools._

## Data Monetization

Unlike tangible assets such as inventory and property, data falls into the same category as assets such as copyrights and software.

Without a process to place a price on a data set - called data valuation - the value of a given data set may be highly subjective and may differ considerably between the perspectives of team members. In fact, it’s possible for an organization to not fully appreciate the value of specific data sets. Without this knowledge, it’s much harder to take advantage of the opportunities such as business growth and operational excellence.

When data provides an economic benefit to an organization, it's called data monetization. It’s a succinct, albeit cruder, way to generally consider the ultimate role of data in a for-profit enterprise.

Data valuation, while generally recommended in larger enterprises, is a requirement for advanced data monetization such as selling or licensing data.

Many ways exist to determine data valuation. Here is a brief summary of a few methods.

- **Cost value method**:  Value is calculated by determining how much it costs to produce, store, and replace lost data. It’s a simple method and can be useful as a lightweight approach, but it is subjective and doesn’t necessarily account for the economic value that the data can produce.
- **Market value approach**:  Value is calculated by researching how comparable data is being priced in the open market. It’s a great approach if market-based comparable data exists but doesn’t work for the vast number of data sets that are not traded.
- **Economic value approach**:  Value is calculated by measuring the impact a data set has on the business’s bottom line. It’s a difficult approach because it may be nearly impossible to identify the specific value of the data relative to other contributors of value.
- **With-and-without method**:  Value is calculated by quantifying the impact on cash flow if a data set needs to be replaced. Scenarios with and without the data are explored and the difference between cash flow is used to determine data value. Like others, this can be challenging to pinpoint the specific impact of a data set.

Assuming your organization realizes that data is a strategic corporate asset, you must be intentional in how you manage that asset. Called _data asset management_, a business must know what data sets it has and understand their value. It must have a plan for utilization and a mechanism to measure return on investment.

_For optimal data monetization, organizations must manage high-value data with the same priority and rigor (and maybe even more) that it treats its most important tangible assets._

## Data-Driven Decision Making

Perhaps the most important value for most enterprises to derive from data is the ability to make better, more-informed decisions. 
_Simply stated, data-driven decision-making (DDDM) is the process of using data to drive business decisions._
Organizations that excel at DDDM achieve it through deliberate actions and investments. Critically, there must be leadership support for a culture that advocates decisions rooted in data appreciation and analytics.

Consider this six-step process to data-driven decision-making:

1. **Define the objectives**: This step involves understanding the objectives relative to the effort and their alignment with organizational goals. This will help you scope the work and define the metrics. In fact, it can be useful to define success and then work backward. For example, if you’re trying to increase sales in a particular region, you need to identify which metrics to capture in order to determine whether you achieved that objective.
2. **Identify the data**: In addition to using a data catalogue, enterprise search, or similar, this step requires engaging with impacted stakeholders. Getting input from a diverse group of people and teams will help you scope the data. This may generate the need to gather data that doesn’t exist. You may need to consult with data stewards, data owners, and others with data governance responsibilities.
3. **Prepare the data**:  After Step 2, you'll understand the degree of preparation you need. If the problem you’re trying to solve is narrow and the data is easily accessible and high-quality, you’ll be in pretty good shape. In most cases, your situation is unlikely to be simple. The data necessary to meet your decision-making objectives will likely come in a variety of formats and will be in need of some remediation. You may need some deep data science skills to prepare the data for use in a data analytics platform.
4. **Analyze the data**:  Once you reach this point, the most exciting part begins. The assumption is that you’re using a useful analytics tool. For complex analysis and continuous efforts, several tools will be used. This could include support for an ETL architecture (Extract, Transform, and Load). This is when data is extracted from one system and made ready and available for use in another. To analyze this data, you will also need relevant representations such as visualizations. These could include graphs and charts. Your tool selection and how the data is presented will depend largely on the audience. For executives, a dashboard may be the right approach.
5. **Determine the findings**:  Once you have data that you can display in a variety of ways, you can ask questions about it. For example, if you’re trying to understand customer demographics relative to sales in a particular region, you may want to toggle between different age ranges. While all phases of DDDM have complexity, the tough work here is knowing which questions to ask. This skill is aided by training, but experience helps.
6. **Take action**:  That’s all there is to this step. Make your decisions. If you’ve completed Steps 1-5 well, but no action is taken (assuming that’s not the decision based on analyzing the data since concluding that no decision is necessary is, in fact, a decision), you’ve wasted a lot of time. DDDM is all about the decisions that result in actions.

_While a first pass at a new problem will require most of these steps in sequence, it’s common to iterate through some of the steps to get to a good place for analysis._

## Developing a Data Strategy for Improved Results

Many organizations take a more passive role relative to their data assets. Efforts are too often reactive. In addition, rather than having a plan and making strategic data-related investments, actions are either complementary to larger initiatives or responsive to some immediate challenge or opportunity.

Consider these reasons that organizations don’t take a proactive approach to managing data:

- “If it ain’t broke”, why fix it?
- It’s too expensive and time-consuming to focus on data.
- It’s far too complicated.
- Data management and governance — what is that?

Every one of these is valid. If your business is not open or able to recognize the potential upside of managing data as a high-value asset, it will be an uphill battle to convince them otherwise. 

That said, once you make the decision to manage data as the high-value asset it is, you’re going to need a plan. That’s when a data strategy becomes the starting point.

### Why does every organization need a data strategy?

_The purpose of any type of strategy is to agree on a set of guiding principles that inform decision-making in support of a desired outcome. In simple terms, it’s the roadmap on how to reach your goals._

Businesses have visions that describe why they exist. They have missions that state what they do. To achieve their visions and missions, a strategy will answer how they will do it.

For a given end-state, people must agree on how decisions will be made and how resources will be allocated. A strategy must have clarity and make it easy for all leaders and team members to know what they need to do, what they need to avoid, and how actions should be prioritized.

Operating without an agreed and current strategy carries enormous risks. People may have different ideas of what the desired outcomes are and as a result conflicts emerge.

_The behavior and outcomes of organizations that have a clear and agreed-upon strategy are often evident. Research shows that they typically execute with efficiency, have higher profits, grow larger, and more frequently hit their other success targets._

_After all, the existence of data does not equate to ensuring it is usable, accessible, high-quality, secure, and compliant. Additionally, turning data into value requires skills, policies, tools, and processes._

You need a data strategy in order to elevate data to become a strategic resource. That strategy should reflect the size and complexity of your business and the industry in which you operate. Small businesses should have a data strategy, but they shouldn’t look anything like those used at a multinational level.

A good data strategy will guide decision-making and resource allocation around data in support of the organization. It will demonstrate and communicate data as a priority and ensure that it is treated in a manner to optimize the success of the organization.

_If your organization doesn’t have a data strategy, create one. If you have a data strategy, make sure it’s current and effectively communicated._
