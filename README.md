## Defining & Understanding Data Governance

### What is Data Governance?

Governance is the manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest. It typically takes the form of how decisions are made, regulated, and enforced. 
When entities grow and increase in complexity, formal governance becomes important. Left ungoverned, the possibility of devolving into chaos is very probable. 

_Governance is the system that formalizes control, processes, and accountabilities so that specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained._

Well-managed data can be transformational, and it can support the desirable qualities of a data-driven culture. This is when decisions at all levels of the organization are made using data in an informed and structured manner such that they deliver better outcomes internally and to customers

Successful data governance also means that data risks can be minimized, and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease. This can bring important comfort to business leaders who, in some jurisdictions, can now be personally liable for issues arising from poor data management.

### Data Governance VS Data Management

_Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data. Data management is the technical implementation of data governance_. For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.

### Data Governance versus Information Governance 

_Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning_. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences. The interest here is in the data, not as much in the business context. _Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders._ 

You should understand the context of data, a concept known as data intelligence, and the desired business outcomes, to complement data governance efforts in a valuable manner.

### The Value of Data Governance

If an organization considers data to be a priority and it puts in place processes and policies to leverage the data’s value and reduce data risks, that organization is demonstrating a strong commitment to data controls and accountabilities. In other words, that organization values data governance.
Fundamentally, data governance is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it. It forces a leap from an ad hoc approach to data to one that is strategic in nature.

Some of the main advantages achieved by good data governance include:

1. Improved data quality
2. Expanded data value
3. Increased data compliance
4. Improved data-driven decision-making
5. Enhanced business performance
6. Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
7. Increased data availability and accessibility
8. Improved data search
9. Reduced risks from data-related issues
10. Reduced data management costs
11. Established rules for handling data

In the absence of formalized data governance, organizations will continue to struggle in achieving these advantages and may, in fact, suffer negative consequences. For example, poor-quality data that is not current, inaccurate, and incomplete can lead to operating inefficiencies and poor decision-making.
Data governance does not emerge by chance. It’s a choice and requires organizational commitment and investment.

## Creating a Data Governance Program

The basic steps for creating a data governance program:

1. Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
2. Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
3. Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
4. Achieving leadership approval.
5. Designing and developing the program.
6. Implementing the program.
7. Monitoring and measuring performance.
8. Maintaining the program.

_In summary, data governance is about managing data well and helping to deliver its optimum value to your organization. It includes ensuring your data is available, usable, and secure. It’s the actions that team members take, the policies and processes they must follow, and the use of technologies that support them throughout the data lifecycle in their organization._

## Developing a Data Governance Framework

Regardless of how and to what degree you implement the elements of a data governance program, you’ll need a basic set of guiding concepts and a structure in which to apply them. This is called the data governance framework.

The data governance framework in Figure 2 is not in a specific order, with the exception of leadership and strategy, which is a prerequisite for the rest of the framework.

### Leadership and Strategy
Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization. For example, how can data governance support the role that data plays in enabling growth in specific markets? Data plays a role in many aspects of organizational strategy, including risk management, innovation, and operational efficiencies, so you must ensure there’s a clear alignment between these aspects and the goals of data governance.

_The disconnect between business goals and data governance is the number one reason that data governance programs fail. When mapping organizational strategy to data governance, you need the support, agreement, and sponsorship of senior leadership. I’ll be blunt about this: Without full support from your organization’s leaders, your data governance efforts won’t succeed._

### Roles and Responsibilities
Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time. Every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities, which range from the information technology (IT) team to data stewards.

_While specific roles do exist, your organization must understand that data governance requires responsibilities from nearly everyone._

### Policies, Processes, and Standards
At the heart of every data governance program are the policies, processes, and standards that guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization. Each of these must be designed, developed, and deployed. Depending on the size and complexity of the organization, this can take significant effort.

_Policies, processes, and standards must include accountability and enforcement components; otherwise it’s possible they will be dead on arrival._

### Metrics
The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results. Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding. You’ll want to know if your efforts are delivering on the promise of the program. Based on the metrics, you and your team can make continuous improvements (or make radical changes) to ensure that the program is producing value.

### Tools
Fortunately, a large marketplace now exists for tools in support of data governance and management. These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance. In recent years, many data science-related tools have made leaps in terms of incorporating ease-of-use and automation. What used to be complex has been democratized and empowered more team members to better manage and derive value from data.

### Communications and Collaboration
With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key. This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops. Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.

_A large number of disparate stakeholders need to work together in order to effectively govern data. Collaboration is essential and can be the difference between success and failure. Good collaboration requires a positive culture that rewards teamwork. It also requires clear channels between teams, such as regular meetings. Online collaboration platforms are increasingly being used too._

## Preparing for Data Governance

Data governance requires careful treatment, beginning with understanding whether an organization is ready to accept it. Being ready as an organization involves determining the extent to which a data culture exists. Ensuring that the organization’s strategy is fully aligned with the proposed program. Misalignment here is the number one reason data governance program deployments fail.
